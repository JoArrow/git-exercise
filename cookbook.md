# Vegan cake

Ingredients:
- 200 g almonds or hazelnuts, ground
- 200 g flour
- 1 pinch baking powder
- 200 g margarine
- 100 g sugar
- 1 packet vanilla sugar
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 organic orange, juice and zest
- 1 jar     cranberries (300–350 g)
- 1 tbsp     powdered sugar
- 1 pinch     ground cinnamon

Grate the orange zest and squeeze the juice. Place all the ingredients for the dough in a large bowl, adding only 2 tablespoons of orange juice at first. Knead with your hands until you have a smooth dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little more juice; if it is too soft, knead in a little more flour. Chill the dough for 20 minutes.

Then line the bottom of a round form pan (26 cm Ø) with baking paper and grease the sides. Knead 2/3 of the dough into the pan, forming a rim about 2 cm high. Spread the cranberries on the dough. Roll out the remaining third of the dough on a floured surface and cut into strips. Brush the edge of the cake with a little water, place the strips in a lattice pattern on the cake, and press down slightly at the edge. Or, for a simpler option, cut out shapes with cookie cutters and place them on the filling.

Bake in a preheated oven at 356°F for about 40–45 minutes.

Once cooled, it's best to wrap the pie in foil and let it sit in a cool place for 2–3 days so the dough gets nice and crumbly and the flavors can really develop.

Before serving, mix 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar with a pinch of cinnamon and dust the cake thinly with it (using a tea strainer).

This cake has a tart, fruity flavor and is not too sweet.
